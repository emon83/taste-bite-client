Features Add this Project : 
 * Firstly we create a website that shows the recipes of all available chefs. The website must be exclusively dedicated to one cuisine(Bangladeshi, Chinese, Indian, Thai, Japanese, Italian, American ). For example, if you give Chinese Chef and Chinese food recipes, it will only have Chinese Chef and Chinese food recipes. 
 * Second we use active nav-link in this project and navbar are mobile responsive. And in Home section we create hero section Hand-Picked Collection section, Explore Latest Recipe section,  What's New section and Footer.
 * Third In Hand-Picked Collection section if you select any card then page goes on Recipe Page and there are  six chef cards. Each card will have the following information: Chef Picture, Chef Name, Years of experience, Numbers of recipes,Likes, View Recipes Button
